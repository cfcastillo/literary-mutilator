	<div id="p-div">
		<p id="p1">Ikebana (生け花, 活け花, "arranging flowers" or "making flowers alive") is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It is also known as Kadō (華道, "way of flowers"). The tradition dates back to the 7th century when floral offerings were made at altars. Later, they were placed in the tokonoma (alcove) of a home. Ikebana reached its first zenith in the 16th century under the influence of Buddhist tea masters and has grown over the centuries, with over 1,000 different schools in Japan and abroad.</p>
		<p id="p2">Kadō is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with kōdō for incense appreciation and chadō for tea and the tea ceremony.</p>
		<p id="p3">"Ikebana" is from the Japanese ikeru (生ける, "to arrange (flowers), have life, be living") and hana (花, "flower"). Possible translations include "giving life to flowers" and "arranging flowers".</p>
